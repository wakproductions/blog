            <p>w
            I&#39;m trying to learn <a href="https://reactjs.org">React.js</a> along with <a href="https://redux.js.org">Redux</a>. These frameworks are
            really complicated to set up and get familiar with on the basics level, so I was hoping that taking an online
            course would get me up to speed with the contextual background knowledge needed to get a single page React app up
            and running.</p>
            
            <p><img src="../../../images/2018/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-fem.png" style="width: 600px" relative="true" alt="Screen shot 2018 01 29 fem" /></p>
            
            <h2>Positive</h2>
            
            <p>So first I&#39;ll start with the good. This course gave me much of the general background I was hoping for. In addition
            to basic React, it covered some of the basic set up of a React single page application beyond the cop out of telling
            you to use <em>create-react-app</em>. By showing you how to integrate into Webpack, it shows you how to use React in a more
            practical sense as you would in a company environment. I got a much better bird&#39;s eye view than I would have from
            reading the official <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">React guides</a> alone.</p>
            
            <p>It also incorporates a lot of useful tools like <em>Prettier</em>, <em>eslint</em>, and testing using <em>Jest</em>. I think I accomplished
            the big goal of getting to understand how <em>Redux</em> incorporates with React. For example, I when I tried approaching
            learning React/Redux independently from the online reference guides, I did not understand that Redux <em>replaces</em> the
            entire state machine that the React tutorials tell you to use. Seeing this in action side by side clicked with me.</p>
            
            <h2>Negative</h2>
            
            <p>Despite getting a good general overview of React through this course, I feel like part of its downfall was that it
            tried to incorporate too much. This course is over 14 hours long, and I&#39;m in a crunch to learn this as fast as I can.
            I think he went into a lot of topics that were unnecessary like <em>Flow</em>. My employer uses <em>Typescript</em> so this is
            something that I think is better served in another tutorial. Of course, you can always skip over those sections, but
            you will get a little lost if you are coding along and following the examples in your own locally hosted project.
            Another minor annoyance is that the instructor would occasionally get stumped by a lint error and spend time debugging
            it. That sort of junk is boring to watch and throws off my learning flow. I paid for this stuff so I expect him to come
            prepared with a Powerpoint and more structured overview.</p>
            
            <p>The biggest problem I have with this course is the same weakness I see with a lot of other coding instruction, including
            <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">CodeSchool</a>. There&#39;s too much &quot;Type this into this file and... wow!&quot; I really hate it when
            an instructor has too much magic going on behind the scenes that he doesn&#39;t explain. This is especially relevant in the
            areas related to configuration like Webpack setup.</p>
            
            <p>Speaking of which, I also tried out the FrontendMasters Webpack tutorial and was disappointed. I just want to know the
            basic structure of Webpack explained in context - but the guy running the 5 hour course rambled off on too many tangents
            such as about Node modules he personally worked on but have no relevance to Webpack. All I wanted to know was X, Y, Z
            steps to set up and configure Webpack to get my SCSS compiled to CSS. Show me how to use the Webpack references by
            providing a good contextual overview and I can take it from here.</p>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <p>I believe the most intimidating thing about learning React is not the React concepts itself, but the whole associated
            array of tools to create a single page application. The <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/">React Guides</a> got me so far,
            but don&#39;t tell you about the essential associated technologies to run the whole big picture like Webpack and Redux.
            FrontendMasters was an okay course, but was really inefficient for my learning style. I wish they just did away with
            the whole video tutorial and wrote out the entire course as a series of blog entries so that I can skim to the
            important parts.</p>
            
            <p>If you want to really learn Redux, <a href="http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html">try this tutorial right here</a>.</p>

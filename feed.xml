    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Installing Twitter Bootstrap into my React.js application took more effort that I would have liked. There were several
problems I ran into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bootstrap v3.3.7 fails&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bootstrap 4 is only beta, but it looks like I&amp;#39;m going to have to use it. I had all sorts of problems getting the
includes and dependencies to work with v3.3.7, such as this inability to resolve fonts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ERROR in ./node_modules/css-loader!./node_modules/postcss-loader/lib?{}!./node_modules/sass-loader/lib/loader.js!./stylesheets/style.scss
Module not found: Error: Can&amp;#39;t resolve &amp;#39;../fonts/bootstrap/glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot&amp;#39; in &amp;#39;/Users/wkotzan/Development/momo-scans-frontend/stylesheets&amp;#39;
 @ ./node_modules/css-loader!./node_modules/postcss-loader/lib?{}!./node_modules/sass-loader/lib/loader.js!./stylesheets/style.scss 7:4360-4422 7:4453-4515
 @ ./stylesheets/style.scss
 @ ./js/App.jsx
 @ multi (webpack)-dev-server/client?http://localhost:8080 ./js/App.jsx
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could probably troubleshoot some more, but not worth the effort given that Bootstrap 3.3.7 will probably be
obsolete very soon. So onto v4.0.0....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;jQuery problems&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to get the Javascript dependencies within Bootstrap working. I have the following at the top of my
&lt;code&gt;App.jsx&lt;/code&gt; application file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="javascript"&gt;import &amp;#39;bootstrap&amp;#39;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I started getting a browser error that the jQuery dependency could not be found and my application page
wouldn&amp;#39;t render. I had to fix this by doing a &lt;code&gt;yarn add jquery&lt;/code&gt; and then adding the following to my Webpack config
file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="javascript"&gt;const webpack = require(&amp;#39;webpack&amp;#39;);

...

  plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      $: &amp;#39;jquery&amp;#39;,
      jQuery: &amp;#39;jquery&amp;#39;
    })
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes the JQuery references in Bootstrap universally available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting the styles to work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the styles to wor, I had to add this line to my master &lt;code&gt;style.scss&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="scss"&gt;@import &amp;quot;~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap&amp;quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I had to add the following processing plugins to my Webpack config file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="javascript"&gt;  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.scss?$/,
        use: [
          { loader: &amp;quot;style-loader&amp;quot; },
          { loader: &amp;quot;css-loader&amp;quot; },
          {
            loader: &amp;quot;postcss-loader&amp;quot;,
            options: {
              plugins: function() {
                return [
                  require(&amp;#39;precss&amp;#39;),
                  require(&amp;#39;autoprefixer&amp;#39;)
                ]
              }
            }
          },
          { loader: &amp;quot;sass-loader&amp;quot; }
        ]
      },
    ]
  },

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Final webpack.config.js&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s my complete Webpack config file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="javascript"&gt;const path = require(&amp;#39;path&amp;#39;);

module.exports = {

          {
            loader: &amp;quot;postcss-loader&amp;quot;,
            options: {
              plugins: function() {
                return [
                  require(&amp;#39;precss&amp;#39;),
                  require(&amp;#39;autoprefixer&amp;#39;)
                ]
              }
            }
          },
          { loader: &amp;quot;sass-loader&amp;quot; }
        ]
      },
      { test: /\.jsx?$/, use: &amp;#39;babel-loader&amp;#39; }
    ]
  },

  ]

    <title>Compiling SCSS to CSS in Webpack - INSANITY!</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m busy learning Webpack and it&amp;#39;s got some weird conventions that quite differ from normal web programming. So
I want to work in SCSS and compile that to a CSS file for use in my project. Here&amp;#39;s what my files look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="html"&gt;&amp;lt;!-- index.html --&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Momentum Stock Scans&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;/dist/style.css&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;/dist/bundle.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="scss"&gt;// style.scss
body {
  font-family: Verdana;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="javascript"&gt;// webpack.config.js
const path = require(&amp;#39;path&amp;#39;)

module.exports = {
  context: __dirname,
  entry: &amp;quot;./js/App.jsx&amp;quot;,
  watch: true,
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, &amp;#39;dist&amp;#39;),
    filename: &amp;#39;bundle.js&amp;#39;
  },
  stats: {
    colors: true,
    reasons: true
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.scss?$/,
        use: [
          { loader: &amp;quot;style-loader&amp;quot; },
          { loader: &amp;quot;css-loader&amp;quot; },
          {
            loader: &amp;quot;sass-loader&amp;quot;
            // options: {
            //   includePaths: [&amp;quot;/stylesheets&amp;quot;]
            // }
          }
        ]
      },
      { test: /\.jsx?$/, use: &amp;#39;babel-loader&amp;#39; }
    ]
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I was expecting this would compile my &lt;code&gt;style.scss&lt;/code&gt; file into a &lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt; file in the &lt;code&gt;dist&lt;/code&gt; directory. But that&amp;#39;s
not how Webpack works. Apparently the output file is a one-shot deal - meaning EVERYTHING goes into &lt;code&gt;bundle.js&lt;/code&gt;, including
other types of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this also means that you have to &lt;strong&gt;REQUIRE THE STYLESHEET&lt;/strong&gt; in the Javascript entry point file. So &lt;code&gt;./js/App.jsx&lt;/code&gt;
should have this line at the top:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="javascript"&gt;require(&amp;#39;../style.scss&amp;#39;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then this compiles the following into the middle of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;dist/bundle.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="javascript"&gt;/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {

eval(&amp;quot;exports = module.exports = __webpack_require__(4)(false);\n// imports\n\n\n// module\nexports.push([module.i, \&amp;quot;body {\\n  font-family: Verdana; }\\n\&amp;quot;, \&amp;quot;\&amp;quot;]);\n\n// exports\n//# sourceURL=[module]\n//# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;charset=utf-8;base64,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\n//# sourceURL=webpack-internal:///3\n&amp;quot;);

/***/ }),

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WTF!!!&lt;/strong&gt; That&amp;#39;s some strange unconventional shit going on right there. But I guess that&amp;#39;s the Webpack way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Review of FrontendMasters React.js/Redux Tutorial v3</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://blog.url.com/2018/01/29/frontendmasters-review.html"/>

      <name>Article Author</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m trying to learn &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org"&gt;React.js&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href="https://redux.js.org"&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt;. These frameworks are
really complicated to set up and get familiar with on the basics level, so I was hoping that taking an online
course would get me up to speed with the contextual background knowledge needed to get a single page React app up
and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../../images/2018/Screen-Shot-2018-01-29-fem.png" style="width: 600px" relative="true" alt="Screen shot 2018 01 29 fem" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Positive&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first I&amp;#39;ll start with the good. This course gave me much of the general background I was hoping for. In addition
to basic React, it covered some of the basic set up of a React single page application beyond the cop out of telling
you to use &lt;em&gt;create-react-app&lt;/em&gt;. By showing you how to integrate into Webpack, it shows you how to use React in a more
practical sense as you would in a company environment. I got a much better bird&amp;#39;s eye view than I would have from
reading the official &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html"&gt;React guides&lt;/a&gt; alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also incorporates a lot of useful tools like &lt;em&gt;Prettier&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;eslint&lt;/em&gt;, and testing using &lt;em&gt;Jest&lt;/em&gt;. I think I accomplished
the big goal of getting to understand how &lt;em&gt;Redux&lt;/em&gt; incorporates with React. For example, I when I tried approaching
learning React/Redux independently from the online reference guides, I did not understand that Redux &lt;em&gt;replaces&lt;/em&gt; the
entire state machine that the React tutorials tell you to use. Seeing this in action side by side clicked with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Negative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite getting a good general overview of React through this course, I feel like part of its downfall was that it
tried to incorporate too much. This course is over 14 hours long, and I&amp;#39;m in a crunch to learn this as fast as I can.
I think he went into a lot of topics that were unnecessary like &lt;em&gt;Flow&lt;/em&gt;. My employer uses &lt;em&gt;Typescript&lt;/em&gt; so this is
something that I think is better served in another tutorial. Of course, you can always skip over those sections, but
you will get a little lost if you are coding along and following the examples in your own locally hosted project.
Another minor annoyance is that the instructor would occasionally get stumped by a lint error and spend time debugging
it. That sort of junk is boring to watch and throws off my learning flow. I paid for this stuff so I expect him to come
prepared with a Powerpoint and more structured overview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem I have with this course is the same weakness I see with a lot of other coding instruction, including
&lt;a href="https://www.codeschool.com/"&gt;CodeSchool&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;#39;s too much &amp;quot;Type this into this file and... wow!&amp;quot; I really hate it when
an instructor has too much magic going on behind the scenes that he doesn&amp;#39;t explain. This is especially relevant in the
areas related to configuration like Webpack setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of which, I also tried out the FrontendMasters Webpack tutorial and was disappointed. I just want to know the
basic structure of Webpack explained in context - but the guy running the 5 hour course rambled off on too many tangents
such as about Node modules he personally worked on but have no relevance to Webpack. All I wanted to know was X, Y, Z
steps to set up and configure Webpack to get my SCSS compiled to CSS. Show me how to use the Webpack references by
providing a good contextual overview and I can take it from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the most intimidating thing about learning React is not the React concepts itself, but the whole associated
array of tools to create a single page application. The &lt;a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/"&gt;React Guides&lt;/a&gt; got me so far,
but don&amp;#39;t tell you about the essential associated technologies to run the whole big picture like Webpack and Redux.
FrontendMasters was an okay course, but was really inefficient for my learning style. I wish they just did away with
the whole video tutorial and wrote out the entire course as a series of blog entries so that I can skim to the
important parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to really learn Redux, &lt;a href="http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html"&gt;try this tutorial right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Bitcoin Will Fail for SHTF</title>

&lt;p&gt;A single Bitcoin today sells more than an ounce of gold — but is it a good currency for SHTF? A lot of people are
hoarding Bitcoin these days because they think it is a way to guard themselves against the demise of the US dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To many people, Bitcoin represents a way to fight back against the banking cartel. They don’t think the government
can regulate it. It sounds like a currency by and for the people. However, as someone who works in the technology
field I see some some technological reasons to think that holding Bitcoin as a long term defensive asset is a bad idea.
Some of the perceived advantages are not as strong as the layperson may believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bitcoin is not anonymous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very basis of how Bitcoin works is the blockchain, meaning that every Bitcoin transaction ever made is recorded
in a public ledger. While the blockchain may be hard to read, theoretically anyone with a sophisticated enough computing
power and some detective work can trace a particular transaction to its origin by looking at all of the addresses on the
ledger. It’s unlike cash in which no record is kept once it’s been moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government can find indirect ways of regulating Bitcoin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government can find ways to regulate the use of Bitcoin by implement rules making it difficult to use. Already, the
IRS classifies Bitcoin as an asset and not a currency, meaning that you have to pay capital gains taxes if your Bitcoin
appreciates in value and you sell it for a profit. This means that in the lens of the financial world, Bitcoin has more
in common with a stock certificate than a US dollar. The Bitcoin nodes and exchanges are also a vulnerable to
regulation. To convert dollars into Bitcoin and back you need to use an exchange. If they got serious about controlling
Bitcoin, the regulators could impose taxes or fees on the use of exchanges, or go after the people running the nodes
that process the Bitcoin ledger. Recently the engineers running the Bitcoin project implemented an update to the
blockchain called SegWit, which was implemented through the exchanges. This is a testament to the fact that there are
bottlenecks in the Bitcoin ecosystem that can be controlled by a regulatory authority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mining nodes in the infrastructure is a vulnerability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/plan-save-blockchain-democracy-bitcoins-civil-war/"&gt;Miners are needed to process the transactions.&lt;/a&gt; This
can come under attack, or without enough infrastructure could run very slow. Right now it could take up to hours for a
Bitcoin transaction to make its way through the ledger. This is a huge impediment when using Bitcoin for commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technological breakthrough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moore’s Law is currently broke for the moment, meaning that over the past several years chip manufacturers have been
having a harder time making processors more powerful at the tepid pace that they have been for the last 20 years. But
let’s say Moore’s Law catches up - if we have a hardware technology breakthrough - what could that mean for
cryptocurrencies like bitcoin? Would a quantum computer be able to break the encryption and crack the digital
signatures by brute force? If that occurs then anyone’s Bitcoin account could be at risk of getting hacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Old fashioned manipulation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited supply of Bitcoins may solve the inflationary problems of money printing, but it’s vulnerable to manipulation through supply and demand - just like a stock price.
        - Market cap is only $42B, but some publicly traded companies have a market cap much higher. Apple has a market cap of $800B. Someone with enough money can control the price of Bitcoin much like a high frequency trader can control the short term price of a stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Final Word&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin is a virtual asset, but it’s a commodity just like any other kind of financial asset. You can make money from
speculation in it, but it’s worth as a store of value in an economic or societal disaster is questionable. Peppers who
are buying Bitcoin may be misguided. I know stocks better, so I’d rather use my speculative money in the stock market.
For ecological disasters, I think it’s better to hold physical assets such as gold, silver, or even commodity goods
that can be traded because those will have a use if the Internet goes down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Superinflation might be the best reason to hold Bitcoin. However, I believe the market has already priced this in
because of the rapidly rising price action it&amp;#39;s seen over the last several years. It looks like a parabolic stock
chart, and many of Bitcoin&amp;#39;s proponents speak of it like an investment that can never fail. Sounds like bubble talk to
me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think cryptocurrencies are unreliable long term holdings as an economic, political, or natural disaster
hedges, there could be other uses for them. I like some of the ideas driving Ethereum, because is has it has a purpose
in running distributed applications and contracts. But that’s for another video.&lt;/p&gt;

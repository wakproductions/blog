Part 1: Genetics and (Mis)Diagnosis
* Doctors often don't identify it correctly - think its contact dermatitis
* Is it caused by an allergy, pathogen, or something genetically wrong with the skin?

Part 2: Allergy Components
  - Genetic component -
  - Allergy to wife's shampoo. Underwear
    - environmental factor to allergy: dogs/cats/shampoo
    - Drugs - Steven's johnson syndrome
  - Allergy to food
  - Fungus

Part 3: Pathogenic components
  - Doctors admit the bacterial element - bleach baths
  - Staph colonization
  - Is treating bacteria fighting the symptom and not the problem?
  - Fungus

Part 4: Treatment Protocols
* Moisurizer, Aveeno products
* My opinion on patch testing - people think the allergist will figure all this out as if they have some fancy lab
  like you'd see on NCIS or something. But their methods are primitive
* Bleach baths
* Topical Steroids
* Additional factors: Stress
  - Worst outbreaks happen during periods of stress. High school.
  - Self care for mental health is an important, often overlooked part of managing eczema. Meditation, massage, see a therapist.
* Additional factors: Low Vitamin D
*
* Anti-fungal medication
*

Part 5: Is there a cure?

title: Github Organization and Project Pages under a single domain with Middleman

I have my primary website [winstonkotzan.com](http://www.winstonkotzan.com/) set up as a Github Pages organization
page. The repo is [wakproductions.github.io](https://github.com/wakproductions/wakproductions.github.io). However,
to start this blog I decided to create a new Middleman repo to keep all the code separate from my base website
and give me more flexibility between managing the blog component and my other content. So I created a new
repo called [blog](https://github.com/wakproductions/blog) which would host all the content in the folder
[winstonkotzan.com/blog](http://www.winstonkotzan.com/blog).

So Github pages have two different flavors. It's got _organization_ pages and _project_ pages. The _organization_
page goes to your root at _myusername.github.io_ while project pages show up at _myusername.github.io/project_name_.
So basically my domain name winstonkotzan.com points to my _organization_ page and my blog is just a statically
generated _project_ page with the project name "blog". One of the things I always found weird about how to upload
your static HTML pages is that the _organization_ page requires the static public web pages to be in the _master_
github branch, but the _project_ pages require the static public web pages to be in a branch named _gh-pages_.
It's weird becuase for my _organization_ page I have to put all the source code in a branch called _source_, whereas
most other repositories use _master_ for the main branch of source code. You can read the full docs on the 
differences between organization and project pages 
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).

Upon the first upload of my blog, I had this problem with the blog pages using the wrong style sheet. This is how my
website looked:

<%= image_tag('2016/Screen_Shot_2016-09-11_at_3.01.42_PM.png', style: 'width: 700px', relative: true) %>

I was able to fix the problem by using the relative links identifiers in the page template.

<%= image_tag('2016/Pasted_Image_9_11_16__3_18_PM.png', style: 'width: 700px', relative: true) %>

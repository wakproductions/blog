This blog is written in a Ruby tool called [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/). I noticed that when trying to share
one of my posts on social media, it doesn't format as nicely as sharing articles from other big media sites.

<%= partial 'image', locals: { filename: '2019/03/bad-social-media-share-link.png', caption: 'How one of my blog articles looked when I tried to share'} %>

<%= partial 'image', locals: { filename: '2019/03/msm-social-media-link-example.png', caption: 'What a nicely formatted blog post share looks like'} %>

## Facebook OpenGraph Tags

I found out that Facebook invented a meta tag standard called [OpenGraph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/#user-agent) which allows you to specify how your blog
post will display when shared on Facebook. Many other social media sites like LinkedIn and Twitter read the same tags.

I was able to fix my blog post display by adding the following meta tags to the `<head>` section of each web page.

```html
<head>
  <meta content='http://www.winstonkotzan.com/2019/03/09/production-https-setup-for-ruby-on-rails-app-with-docker.html' property='og:url'>
  <meta content='article' property='og:type'>
  <meta content='Human Readable Title of the Blog Post' property='og:title'>
  <meta content="Short description of my blog post." property='og:description'>
  <meta content='https://my-blog-url.com/link/to/image-to-display.png' property='og:image'>
  <meta content="Same as the og:description value above" name='twitter:card'>
</head>
```

Facebook also has a [debugger tool](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwinstonkotzan.com%2Fblog%2F2019%2F02%2F04%2Fthree-allergic-triggers-that-can-cause-eczema.html)
that can help you validate your HTML meta tag markup.

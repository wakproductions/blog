Welcome to my blog, where I will be covering technical topics encountered in my work as a software engineer. This is
to act as a reference for myself, my team, and others who may be facing similar technical challenges. This won't be a
traditional blog with static articles as I plan to retroactively update many of these posts. Think of it more as a
Wiki on technical topics.  

```ruby

class MyClass
  attr_reader :myvalue

  def initialize
    myvalue = 2
  end
end
```

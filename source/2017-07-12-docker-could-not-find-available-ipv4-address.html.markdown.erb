title: Capistrano + Docker could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv4 address pool among the defaults to assign to the network

So on my latest Capistrano deploy to [MomentumStockScans.com](http://www.momentumstockscans.com), I received the following
error:

```
$ sudo docker-compose up -d
sudo: unable to resolve host ip-172-30-0-194
Creating network "20170713014600_default" with the default driver
ERROR: could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv4 address pool among the defaults to assign to the network
```

Turns out every time I was running `docker-compose` it created a new bridge network, and [there's a limit of 31 networks
on the system](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/23971)!

When I did `docker network ls`, it gave me a whole list of networks it created. One for each deploy. I cleared them using

```
$ sudo docker network prune
```

Everything was fine! Will add the above command to my Capistrano deploy script.
